<h4> What we do?</h4>
<p>
	If you are one among many who suffer from water shortage then we can deliver water at your doorstep.
	We collect saved rainwater and make it available to the general public. 
	If you are a part of an organisation then we can team up to save more rainwater.
	You can harvest rainwater for us and we will pay you for the water you save. 
</p>

<h4> How we do it?</h4>
<p>
	We collaborate with multiple institutions/organisations to save rainwater.
	These institutions store excess water and as and when required this water is collected and delivered to people who need it.
</p>

<h4>What is our Aim?</h4>
<p>
	We aim to help the common people by acting as an intermediary.
	We hope to bring multiple organisations under 1 banner and help the general public during hard times.
